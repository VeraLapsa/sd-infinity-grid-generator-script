                            This page is a Mega-Grid of Stable Diffusion settings, intended to help educate about what each of these options is, and what the results of changing the options are.
                            <br>If you're brand new to SD, you're on the wrong page, this page will be too overwhelming. Find a beginner's guide to SD, and install the <a href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI</a>. Consider joining the <a href="https://discord.gg/vrfEcaBTRC">r/StableDiffusion discord as well</a>.
                            <br>If you've tried the basics of SD and are looking to understand the features like Samplers, Step counts, CFG Scale, etc. this is the perfect page for you.
                            <br><br>For example, to see how Samplers and Step Counts compare, scroll to the grid at the bottom, and select the <code>Steps</code> for the X-Axis and <code>Samplers</code> for the Y-Axis and you'll get a 2D grid showing how they compare.
                            <br><br>You can also view the Samplers selector to view descriptions of each Sampler, and a description of the concept of a Sampler on the left side. Note that these descriptions are scrollable.
                            <br><br>Every axis is selectable - for example, you can have X=Steps, Y=Samplers, and then click between different Prompts or different Models.

                            Stable Diffusion is a <i>Latent Diffusion Text-To-Image Artificial Intelligence model</i>.
                            <br><br>&bullet; The meaning of the "<code>text to image AI model</code>" part is simple enough: it's a magic blackbox that you put text into, and get images out.
                            <br><br>&bullet; The "<code>diffusion</code>" word indicates that it works not by having the AI just pump out an image from nothing, but instead it generates random noise and has the AI "denoise" the image: it tries to guess what the image was before it was compressed to random noise. This is a magic trick to make the AI produce much higher quality outputs than it otherwise could. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CIpzeNxIhU">Here's a video from Dr. Mike Pound at Computerphile on how this works.</a>
                            <br><br>&bullet; The word "<code>latent</code>" means that it's not working on the raw pixels for denoising, instead it's working on seemingly-meaningless data inside the AI's core that <i>represents</i> sections of pixels. The important thing about this is that it's a magic trick to speed up the AI by letting it get the same results while working with much less data, not to mention letting it generate optimized forms of the image data.

        title: Model
        description: >
                     The model, sometimes referred to as a 'checkpoint' (due to the historical tendency of releasing models using '<code>ckpt</code>' python pickle checkpoint files), is the big primary file used by Stable Diffusion.
                     It contains all the data the AI needs to run, other than the processing code.
                     <br>StabilityAI spent millions of dollars training a brand new model from scratch with SD 1.x. Other releases, especially those from other organizations, started from Stability's model and added more training data into it.
                     <br>Training takes the form of <i>native training</i> (creating new models or adding into them), <i>finetuning</i> (similar to native training, but with an emphasis on just improving the details or adding some new concepts in), and <i>DreamBooth</i> (adding a single concept or small number of concepts in way that runs very quickly but can damage parts of the model other than the basis).
                     <br>Model files contain several gigabytes of data (about 2 GiB for fp16 fines, 4 GiB for fp32 files, and 7 GiB for the original releases that contained extra data).
                     <br>FP32 and FP16 are largely equivalent, with only a small loss of precision for FP16, with the benefit of only need half as much filespace. In most cases, you want the FP16 version of a model. The extra precision of FP32 is most useful for training with.
                     <br>The primary component of a model is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-Net">UNet</a> - the part of the AI that handles the diffusion steps.
                     <br>It also contains data for the text encoder, and a VAE (refer to the VAE selector for details on VAE).
                     <br>
                     <br>Models available for download online include native-trained options (SD1.x, SD2.x, NAI, WD, ...), finetuned models, custom DreamBooth models (a variety exist that teach the AI various styles or specific concepts, some popular examples include "EldenRingDiffusion" that teaches the AI the styles of the game 'Elden Ring', "HassanBlend" which teaches the AI NSFW concepts, ...), merged models (a merged model contains data from multiple different other models, for example one might have 50% WD and 50% SD for a mix of the anime and realistic stylings).
                     <br>
                     <br>Checkpoint files are "pickles", meaning they contain python executable code. This can theoretically be used for malicious purposes. Be careful downloading "<code>.ckpt</code>" or "<code>.pt</code>" files from unknown sources.
                     <br>Modern model file distribution is recommended to be done with "<code>.safetensors</code>" files. These files contain only the model data, with no room for code injection.
                     <br>If you want to use a model from a questionable source, but only a "<code>ckpt</code>" is available, ask the author to post a "<code>safetensors</code>" version.
                     <br>
                     <br>Note that official SD models come as both "EMA" and "nonEMA" forms. "EMA" means "Exponential Moving Average", and is a way to compensate for an issue with AI training where the AI overrepresents the last few images it sees. In a choice between EMA and nonEMA, you mostly want the EMA version. The nonEMA version is only useful (but still not even required) if you're going to continue training the model further. This gets confused as some older models released had names like "full-ema", wherein the "full" meant "also including non-ema", and the other model didn't mention "ema" at all, but in fact was the EMA-only version, ie the preferred version.

                title: Stable Diffusion 1.5
                description: >
                             SD1.5, The primary original Stable Diffusion model, released October 20th, 2022, as further training over top of SD1.4 (released August 25th, 2022).
                             <br>StabilityAI (AI startup founded by Emad Mostaque), RunwayML (company that creates AI-assisted content-creation software), and Compvis (Computer Vision and Learning research group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich) worked together to create the original versions of Stable Diffusion. First privately as SD 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. After 1.3 was leaked, they went public with SD 1.4. Soon after, they developed SD 1.5. Each version of the 1.x series was based on the same system, just trained further each time. StabilityAI was unwilling to release SD 1.5 to the public due to pressure from government entities concerned with the potential danger of AI image generation. RunwayML took it into their own hands to release the model anyway, as they had equal rights to do so.
                             <br>As an interesting bit of history trivia: because SD1.3 was leaked, SD1.4 was released by CompVis, and SD1.5 was released by RunwayML, StabilityAI never actually released any stable diffusion model until the later release of SD2.0.
                             <br>This model is trained to work with OpenAI's CLIP to encode text. While the software for this is open source, CLIP's model was created using private/secret training data and methods, leading to some to consider it counterproductive to open source AI to rely on it. It's known to heavily weight images from modern online content creators moreso than anything else, which fueled controversy about potential artist copyright abuse.
                             <br>This model is trained for <b>512x512</b> images primarily, and struggles with any resolution more than a small range away from this.

                             NovelAI is a for-profit company that developed their own SD model and features for a web interface they charge for access to.
                             <br>When their "NovelAI Anime-Final" SD model was leaked, they were upset and tried to put a stop to its spread.
                             Soon after, however, they claimed that they intended to release their work to the public anyway, and they were only upset that somebody stole their ability to have an awesome public launch, not that the content itself was available freely to users.
                             <br>There are a lot of back and forth claims and arguments from NovelAI and in response to them. It is not the job of this grid website to tell you what to think about that or who's wrong or right.
                             However, the NovelAI model is easily available to the public and popular in many communities, therefore I decided it is worthwhile to include in this grid. (I am only including generated output examples for educational usage, and am not distributing any of their private data).
                             <br>This model is varyingly referred to as "NAI", "NovelAI", "The leaked anime model", ...
                             <br>This model is continued from SD 1.x, with some resolution-handling improvements, and is optimal for generations ranging between <b>512x512</b> to <b>768x768</b> but can also go a little outside of that range.
                             <br>The training data used danbooru tags as the text prompt, and so the best usages of NAI will use danbooru tags separated by commas.

        title: VAE
        description: >
                     The "VAE", short for "Variational AutoEncoder", is the part of the SD model that converts between real images and latent-space. For SD 1.x, the VAE scales by a factor of 8 - meaning a 512x512 image gets encoded down to only a 64x64 grid of latent space values.
                     <br>This means that for each single latent data point, the VAE must produce 8x8 (64 total) pixels.
                     <br>In early days of SD, the importance of the VAE was underestimated - it was later discovered that a VAE could be separately trained and extended and the results are dramatically better quality of output than training the base model on its own.
                     <br>As such, StabilityAI and other organizations began releasing separated VAE models, which can now be loaded in and swapped around freely in modern SD UIs.
                     <br>A VAE can be thought as a very specialized type of AI image upscaler, that only works with the main AI model's latent data - and, thanks to this data, works much better than a normal image upscaler.

    sampler:
        title: Sampler
        description: >
                     The sampler is the algorithm used to process each step of the AI diffusion model.
                     <br>The details are a deeply technical topic, and the descriptions provided here are just loose summaries provided by a non-expert.
                     <br>There's a long list of samplers, each with different details. For the purposes of this generated grid, only a few representative samplers from each <i>category</i> of related samplers are provided.
                     <br>A key term to know here is "convergence": a sampler "converges" when it reaches the number of steps where increasing the step count wouldn't change the output noticeably.
                     <br>The categories can be roughly separated into:
                     <br> - the main converging set (DDIM, PLMS, Euler, DPM2, ...) - these all get the same results as eachother using different methods.
                     <br> - The Karras converging set (DPM++ 2M Karras, LMS Karras, ...) - these all also get the same results as eachother, but slightly different from the main set. 'Karras' refers to an alternative 'noise scheduler' (the thing that builds the random start to each image based on seed) that enables convergence in fewer steps.
                     <br> - Ancestral samplers - these produce wildly variant outputs based on the addition of extra random noise between steps. They don't necessarily converge at all - adding more steps adds more random noise, and so produces different outcomes.
                     <br> Some samplers measure step counts different - for example, DPM2 actually does 2 steps for every 'step', and 'DPM Adaptive' ignores your step count input and automatically determines how many steps are needed for convergence.

                description: Euler a, for "Euler Ancestral", aka "k_euler_ancestral", is similar to the "Euler" sampler, but uses "ancestral" sampling - meaning essentially it adds extra random noise as it goes, which in practices leads to a much larger variety of output images, with the downside that it does not converge with other samplers. Many samplers have ancestral variants available.

DPM stands for "Diffusion probabilistic models", and DPM2 comes from a paper titled "DPM-Solver&#58; A Fast ODE Solver for Diffusion Probabilistic Model Sampling in Around 10 Steps". As the paper title says, it does - it converges in about 10 steps. The downside of this sampler is that every 'step' is actually two steps - ie it takes as much time to run 10 DPM2 steps as it does 20 Euler steps, making the improved convergence rate fairly redundant.

In practice, it converges almost as fast as DPM2, but without needing double-steps - so it actually achieves the speed boost originally promised by DPM2.

This particular sampler does so extremely quickly - it's basically done within 10 steps. Many samplers have Karras variants available.

        title: CFG Scale
        default: 7
        description: >
                     CFG Scale, short for "Classifier Free Guidance" scale, is a multiplier on how much your input prompt text affects the image each step.
                     <br>To understand why this system is used, look no further than the output of the '1' option - without multiplying, the image barely resembles the text at all.
                     <br>For whatever reason, the AI just doesn't prioritize the text enough - rather than finding a native solution to this, the developers of Stable Diffusion chose instead to just multiply the effects of text.
                     <br>At an internal level, this works by running every diffusion step twice - once with text, once without. Then, the 'without' is subtracted from the 'with', to get a value that represents just the effects of the text input - then, this value can be multiplied by CFG Scale, and added back ontop of the 'without'.
                     <br>Or, in (simplified) mathematical form: <code>finalGen = emptyGen + ((textGen - emptyGen) * cfgScale)</code>, where each variable ranges from 0 to 1.
                     <br>While low scaling values ignore text, high values overbake text - view the '20' scale example to see how that goes. An overbaked image tends to look very highly saturated, with very sharp lines between black and white.
                     <br>An image that's slightly overscaled is essentially made to approach the Text Encoder's quintessential image for that text, with no room left for the image-generator's creativity on details.
                     <br>An image that's extremely overbaked stops having meaning of its own, and is instead a simple mathematical error.
                     <br> Consider for example a single pixel, where it has an emptyGen of 0.4 and textGen of 0.45:
                     <br> - for cfgScale of 1, the equation is "<code>f = 0.4 + ((0.45 - 0.4) * 1) = 0.4 + (0.05 * 1) = 0.45</code>".
                     <br> - For cfgScale 7, "<code>f = 0.4 + (0.05 * 7) = 0.75</code>".
                     <br> - For cfgScale of 20, "<code>f = 0.4 + (0.05 * 20) = 0.4 + (1.0) = 1.4</code>" ... this is a problem because "1.4" is higher than the maximum "1", therefore it gets clipped off. When a difference of "0.05" or "0.03" or "0.07" all end up with a pixel value of "1" due to clipping at the top, it's inevitable that the image simply becomes a flat empty image. All the detail is in the value over "1", and so all the detail is removed.
                     <br>Note also how changing the step count affects the results of the CFG Scale.

    steps:
        title: Steps
        description: >
                     The step count is, in short, how many times to run the Diffusion model on the image before producing an output.
                     <br>More steps means it runs more times, and also asks for less denoising between each step.
                     <br>Broadly speaking, more steps means better quality output, up to a point.
                     <br>More steps also naturally means longer to run.
                     <br>Many users like to run at lower step counts (for speed) until they get what they want, then re-run with a very high step count (for quality) to create their final output image.
                     <br>Step counts strongly relate to samplers - different samplers treat step counts differently. 'DPM Adaptive' for example ignores the step count value entirely, to calculate it on its own. Other samplers might secretly run two or more steps per 'step' for various forms of internal benefit. Refer to the sampler selection for specifics.

                     <br>For many simple prompts, you might notice more similarities between seeds than you might expect, particular at the level of basic structure and image composition - for example, the line separating sky from ground in a landscape image might be the exact same line that separates a person's neck from their shirt.
                     <br>When playing with prompts, it is important to try many different seeds - at the easiest, just have a large batch count (4 or more) or use a random seed. This helps separate whether your prompt is missing something, or if a seed just has 'bad luck' of not seeding the details you need.
